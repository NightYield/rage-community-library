# rage-community-library
A shared library for all "RAGE Plugin Hook" plugin developers. The goal of this project is to share knowledge and existing implementations for the Rage Plugin Hook to enable faster development of new plugins and avoid research work for Rage mechanics that were already figured out. 

# Contribution

Open source projects depend on contributions. If you are a GTA5 mod developer and feel like you have something to share, do it! Please add your code, create a pull-request and help us to extend this library. We all can benefit from sharing our knowledge, to enable other devs to create new and exciting projects that can be enjoyed by everyone. 

Contributions can be done in the way you prefer, in general I suggest the GitHUb flow https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

# Code Style
No specific code style will be enforced on this project, but there are some basic concepts everyone should stick to when contributing. 
* Use PascalCasing for public classes and methods
* One class = One File (except for privat classes)
* Add a summary to give the reader more insights
* Try to stick with common GTA/Rage wording (for example based on Native DB). This will make it easier to look up related code and topics.
